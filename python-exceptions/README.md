- **Errors and Exceptions**
- **Learn to Program 11: Static & Exception Handling** (start at minute 7)

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain â€” without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Whatâ€™s the difference between errors and exceptions
- What are exceptions and how to use them
- When to use exceptions appropriately
- How to correctly handle an exception
- Whatâ€™s the purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a built-in exception
- When and how to implement clean-up actions after an exception

---

## âœ… Project Requirements

### General

```
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of each file must be: #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file is required at the root of the project
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be checked using wc
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example Exception Handling

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def safe_divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("You can't divide by zero!")
        return None
    finally:
        print("Cleaning up...")

safe_divide(10, 0)
```

## ðŸ§¼ Clean-Up Patterns

This project may include utility scripts like `maidcleanup` to remove artifacts generated during development:

- `__pycache__/`
- `*.pyc`
- `*.log`
- `*.tmp`

Use the `maidcleanup` tool or custom scripts to keep your workspace clean and compliant with submission rules.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Tips

- Run `pycodestyle your_script.py` to validate style
- Make files executable: `chmod +x your_script.py`
- Ensure all scripts start with: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Confirm line endings and length with: `cat -e your_script.py` and `wc your_script.py`
