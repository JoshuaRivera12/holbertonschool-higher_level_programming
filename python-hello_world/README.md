## 🖋️ Author’s Disclaimer

Welcome to the world of Python!

In Python (like many high-level languages), there are often multiple ways to achieve the same result.  

- Some tasks will require a specific solution.
- Other tasks can be solved in several different ways.

Python has a style guide called **PEP8**, now also known as **pycodestyle**.

- At Holberton, we won’t start with **pycodestyle** because it’s stricter than PEP8.
- Don’t worry if you see warnings when running **PEP8** — you can ignore them for now.

> **Enjoy coding!**
