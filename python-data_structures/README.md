# 📚 Python Project: Lists, Tuples & Sequences

This project will help you understand and work with **lists**, **tuples**, and **sequences** in Python. By the end, you should be able to confidently explain how these data structures work — without using Google!

---

## 🥅 Learning Objectives

You should be able to clearly explain:

- **Lists**:  
  What they are, how to create and use them.

- **Lists vs Strings**:  
  How they are similar and different.

- **Common List Methods**:  
  How to use popular methods like `append()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, etc.

- **Lists as Stacks and Queues**:  
  Using `.append()` / `.pop()` (stack) and `.pop(0)` (queue).

- **List Comprehensions**:  
  How to create lists quickly with one-liners.

- **Tuples**:  
  What they are, how to use them.

- **Tuples vs Lists**:  
  When to use tuples instead of lists.

- **Sequences**:  
  What sequences are (things you can loop through: strings, lists, tuples).

- **Tuple Packing & Unpacking**:  
  How to pack multiple values into a tuple and unpack them into variables.

- **`del` Statement**:  
  How to delete elements from lists or entire variables.

## 📖 Resources

You should read or watch the following materials before starting:

- **3.1.3 Lists**  
- **Data Structures** *(up to 5.3 Tuples and Sequences included)*  
- **Learn to Program 6: Lists**

## ⚙️ Requirements

### ✅ Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with **Python 3.8.5**
- Every Python file must:
  - End with a new line
  - Start with this exact line:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    ```
  - Pass **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.\*)
  - Be **executable**
  - Will be checked for length using `wc`

### 📄 README.md  
This file (you’re reading it!) is **mandatory** and must be at the root of your project folder.

## 🚀 Let’s get started!

By completing this project, you'll master one of the most important parts of Python — how to work with data collections like **lists**, **tuples**, and **sequences** in a clean, efficient way.

## Lists vs Strings
Both are sequences (you can loop through them), but:
Lists can contain different types + can change (mutable)
Strings only contain characters + cannot change (immutable)

- python
- Copy
- Edit
- my_list = [1, 2, 3]
- my_string = "abc"

- print(my_list[0])  # 1
- print(my_string[0])  # 'a'
